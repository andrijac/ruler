Download working version:

Original project was developed by Jeff Key:

- http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/ruler/
- http://ruler.codeplex.com/

I wanted to add some features and to have it hosted on GitHub.

<a name="newfeatures" href="#newfeatures">#</a>New features:

- Duplicate ruler - often I need 2 rulers, with exactly same properties (TopMost, Show tool tip etc.) so there is now quick way to do it.

- Lock ruler from resizing - it happens from time to time that when I move ruler around with mouse I accidentally resize it.

- Set size dialog - to set exact size I want ruler to be, not to try to adjust it with keyboard or mouse pixel by pixel.

Support for .NET 2.0 is kept.
